#Character Encoding

Attempt the following programming exercises.

You may find the following code sample helpful:

````python
chr(5) #converts a given integer to the equivalent character
ord("a") #converts a given character to the equivalent integer
````

##Task 1

Write a program which will give the user **two options**:

1. Convert an ASCII code to its equivalent text character
2. Convert a text character to its equivalent ASCII code

The interface to this program should be **user friendly**.

##Task 2
Write a program that will allow the user to provide an **8-bit** binary number as a text string. The program will then output the **denary** representation of this number.

##Task 3
Improve the program from Task 2 so that you have the additional option of providing a two digit **hexadecimal** number. The program will again output the **denary** equivalent.
